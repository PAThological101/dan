<h1>1.1 About PAAB</h1>

<p>The Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) is comprised of a group of multi-stakeholder industry experts that work together to advocate truthful and balanced health product representation that is compliant with federal legislative regulation. Overseeing trusted healthcare communications since 1976, PAAB operates as an independent advisor for preclearance with patient well-being as its top priority.</p>

<p>In granting preclearance and with it the authorization to use the PAAB logo on advertising materials directed to healthcare professionals, PAAB will adopt the standards specified within the Code of Advertising Acceptance (Code) to all categories of healthcare products, including pescription drugs, non-prescription drugs, biologicals, homeopathy and natural health products. PAAB is recognized for making decisions about claims in advertising for healthcare professionals based on the review of evidence. PAAB will not grant approval or allow the use of its logo for advertising materials directed to healthcare professionals, patients or consumers that do not meet the standards of evidence defined within the Code, irrespective of the category of healthcare product. PAAB reviews materials developed by pharmaceutical manufacturers predominantly for the purpose of advertising or promoting a product to healthcare professionals and increasing their awareness of that brand. By their very nature, the utility of these materials in providing complete information about a product is limited; however, PAAB ensures that any information provided about a product is evidence-based and that there is a balance between claims about benefits and possible risks. The PAAB preclearance service is recognized and endorsed by Health Canada. PAAB maintains a liaison with Health Canada regarding the regulation of promotional activities for healthcare products. </p>

<ol>
	<li>PAAB is a not-for profit, self-financing organization funded by the fees paid by advertisers for preclearance review and not for the acceptance of materials </li>
	<li>PAAB offers an opinion service for direct-to-consumer materials.</li>
</ol>

<h1>1.2 Description of the Code</h1>

<p>The Code is the standard by which PAAB reviews health product advertising communication for preclearance. The Code has been created and approved by a multi-stakeholder board to promote communications that enable industry to present products in a manner that is truthful, consistent with the TMA, evidence-based and offers a balanced view of benefits and risks. The standards within the Code are designed to promote an ethical approach to providing factual health product information; an approach that results in an opportunity to make optimum health choices. The purpose of the Code is to foster full, fair and balanced disclosure. </p>

<p>The Code can be viewed in two formats: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Sequential Order </li>
	<li>Organized by Key Principles</li>
</ol>

<p class="cn" id="cs1_2_1">1.2.1 Materials Regulated as Advertising</p>
<p>Materials regulated as advertising and subject to preclearance review by PAAB are classified based on the following guideline supplied by Health Canada: </p>

<p>"Advertisement includes any representation by any means whatever for the purpose of promoting directly or indirectly the sale or disposal any food, drug, cosmetic or device." </p>

<p>For further clarification on how Health Canada uses contextual factors to help determine whether a given message is advertising, see the below links to information supplied by Health Canada: </p>

<p class="cn" id="cs1_2_2">1.2.2 How to Navigate the Code</p>
<p>Choosing the right method of viewing the Code for your purpose: </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sequential Order</p>
<p>This format offers users an overall understanding of PAAB, its relationship to Health Canada, the goals of preclearance, and the Code standards.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Key Principles</p>
<p>This format has been created to simplify the preclearance review process. In this format, the Code standards are broken down and separated into sections that reflect the corresponding principle that inspires a particular requirement. The principles highlight the fundamentals of ethical health product communications to offer full, fair and balanced disclosure. PAAB employs these principles in its review for preclearance. This format can assist in understanding of the nature of the review process and subsequent decisions. During the submission process, users are encouraged to consider their communications with these key principles in mind.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Truthfulness</li>
	<li>Consistency</li>
	<li>Transparency</li>
	<li>Relevancy</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information on the Code standards can be accessed via Supplementary Guidance and Advisory documents. The Q&A resource called Ask PAAB is an opportunity to submit a question directly to PAAB, or view previous or similar enquires and responses on a related topic. It is can be accessed here or from the main menu.</p>

<h1>1.5 Materials Not Subject to Preclearance</h1>

<p class="cn" id="cs1_5_a">A)	Learning Materials </p>
<p>Information materials that have been independently controlled and prepared, with industry involvement limited to purchase and/or sponsorship of the distribution (e.g. a textbook). Collaterals such as reports that contain sections of accredited Healthcare Professional Meetings or Continuing Education (CE) events or activities organized independently of the sponsor of the materials and those materials are not focused on, or provide emphasis on, the sponsor's product(s). This means these materials do not promote the sale of the sponsor's product(s). See the Health Canada guideline "The Distinction Between Advertising and Other Activities," regarding the section: "Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Scientific Symposia/Exhibits," that states: "Moreover, reports, edited scripts or recorded videos of the proceedings, in whole or in part, that concern a specific drug may be advertising if they are disseminated by the sponsor, or the sponsor's agent, to a wider audience after the meeting." </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Please note that these items are not required for PAAB preclearance review, however, they may fall under the definition of "advertising" in the Food & Drugs Act and Regulations. See the Health Canada Policy "The Distinction Between Advertising and Other Activities" on the Health Canada website. See definition of advertising. </li>
		<li>Materials that are created by the academic organizers of accredited Continuing Education events or activities may be distributed at the event or to the registrants of that meeting at a later date.</li>
		<li>If materials are to be distributed after the event to non-participants of the event by a sponsor company, and product or therapeutic claims, comparative data or statements regarding the sponsor's products are emphasized; the complete document must be submitted to PAAB for preclearance. The respective roles of the authors and the sponsoring pharmaceutical company must be stated clearly on the title page. </li>

<h1>1.7 How to Register a Complaint or Make an Appeal </h1>
<p>Skip this section for now</p>
<!--
A)	Introduction 
This section contains a guide for the resolution of complaints against pharmaceutical advertising that is subject to preclearance by PAAB. In following these administrative procedures, it should not be necessary for organizations to act through legal counsel. As with all self-regulation, organizations are encouraged to act in the spirit of the Code to seek resolution and abide by those terms, even in specific situations that are not directly anticipated within this section. 

PAAB will rule on all complaints relating to materials sponsored by health product manufacturers that fall within the scope of the Code. 

See Health Canada Guidance Document "Health Canada and Advertising Preclearance Agencies' Roles Related to Health Product Advertising" for more information. 

B)	Access to Complaint Procedure 
Complaints against Advertising/Promotion Systems (APS) may be lodged by: health professionals, health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, federal regulatory bodies including Health Canada and drug payer organizations including provincial ministries of health. 

C)	Access to Complaint Procedure 
1.	Format and Content of Complaint 
Complaints must be in written form. The complaint should set out in a clear manner such that the aspects of the APS that are the subject of complaint are defined clearly and refer to the sections of the Code that the APS is alleged to violate. 
2.	Attachments to the Complaint 
A copy of the APS under dispute should be attached. Articles or other information cited in the complaint also should be attached, unless these sources have been cited as references in an APS reviewed and accepted by PAAB. 
3.	Complaints against APS not reviewed by PAAB 
Complaints may also be lodged against promotional material that does not carry the PAAB logo and appears not to have been accepted by PAAB. In these cases, complaint letters should first assert that the piece should have been reviewed by PAAB, and then may complain against subject material of the Advertising / Promotion Systems (APS) alleged to violate the Code. As soon as the advertiser has been notified of the complaint against an APS that had not been issued a PAAB acceptance, any further use of that APS must cease until the complaint has been reviewed and a ruling issued. 

D)	Signing Authority
A senior official of the complainant organization must sign complaints. If the organization has directed a third party, such as an advertising agency, to prepare a complaint, the senior official must sign to indicate his or her concurrence. 

E)	Process if Complainant is a Pharmaceutical Company 
Complaint Resolution Stage 1: 

1.	Intercompany Dialogue 
PAAB wishes to encourage direct communications between the complainant and the advertiser. The complainant company should address the letter of complaint, described in Complaint Letters, directly to the advertiser, with a copy sent to the Commissioner.

2.	Advertiser's Response
The advertiser shall make written response to the complainant no later than 10-business days after the complaint is received at the advertiser's place of business. A copy of the response should be sent to the Commissioner. The response shall address each part of the complaint, and indicate whether the advertiser intends to revise the APS or, if not, why the APS does not violate the Code. Such a response might show, for example, how the contested claims are adequately supported by the references cited in the APS. 

3.	Procedure if Advertiser Not Notified 
If the complainant does not notify the advertiser but sends a letter of complaint to the Commissioner, the Commissioner will provide a copy to the advertiser. The 10-day period for response will begin on the date of receipt of this copy at the advertiser's place of business. 

4.	Special Intercompany Dialogue Procedures 
Companies are encouraged to meet in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If a resolution is found, or an extension to the 10- day response period is needed, the complainant should notify the Commissioner. 

5.	Options Facing Complainant
When the complainant receives a response from the advertiser, the complainant may wish to assess whether to: 
i)	Continue discussion with the advertiser, possibly by writing another letter narrowing the points of dispute; 
ii)	Accept the advertiser's response and therefore not pursue the complaint; or 
iii)	iii) Conclude that further intercompany dialogue will not be productive and therefore seek review by the Commissioner in Stage 2. The complainant should send a letter of intent to proceed to Stage 2. The Commissioner should receive the letter within 10-business days of the date of receipt of the advertiser's Stage 1 response by the complainant. The Stage 2 allegations should be clearly stated. Failure to comply with this section will result in the Commissioner voiding the complaint. If the complainant requests action after the 10-business day deadline, they may file a new Stage 1 complaint. 

6.	Registration of Complaints to Proceed to Stage 2 Resolution 
In order for a complaint to pass to Stage 2, the complaint must be registered by sending written confirmation to the Commissioner that the company wishes to pursue the complaint. A registration fee of $500 will be charged to the complainant company at this time; the fee is refundable if the complaint is found valid. 

7.	Procedure if Advertiser Does Not Respond 
If no response from the advertiser is received by PAAB or the complainant within 10-business days of the date of receipt of the complaint, the complainant company is entitled to move immediately to request registration of the complaint. 

8.	Registration of Complaint in Exceptional Circumstances 
The Commissioner is permitted to register a complaint (and proceed to the Stage 2 review), before the 10-day period for advertiser's response has elapsed when regulatory or independent medical advice suggests that the claims may constitute an imminent and/or significant health hazard. No registration fee will be charged in these cases.

F)	Process if Complainant is not a Pharmaceutical Company 
Complaints resolution Stage 1:     

1.	Initiation of Complaint
The complainant may address the letter of complaint, described in Complaint Letters, to the Commissioner. 

2.	Notification of Advertiser 
The Commissioner will then send a copy of the complaint letter to a Senior Official of the advertiser, unless the complainant specifically requests anonymity; in that case the Commissioner will provide an excerpt of the complaint to the advertiser. 

3.	Advertiser's Response 
The advertiser shall make written response to the Commissioner no later than 10-business days after receipt of the complaint. The Commissioner will ensure that the complainant receives a copy of the response. The response shall address each part of the complaint, and indicate whether the advertiser intends to revise the APS or, if not, why the APS does not violate the Code, showing, for example, how the contested claims are adequately supported by the references cited in the APS. 

4.	Registration of Complaint 
In order for a complaint to pass to Stage 2, the complaint must be registered. In Complaints Resolution Stage 1, complainants other than from pharmaceutical companies are not liable to pay registration fees. If the advertiser does not respond by 10-business days after receipt of the complaint, registration is deemed to occur on the subsequent business day. If the advertiser does respond within 10-business days, the complainant may request registration by notifying the Commissioner. The complainant should send a letter of intent to proceed to Stage 2. The letter should be received by the Commissioner within 10-business days of the date of receipt of the advertiser's Stage 1 response by the complainant. The Stage 2 allegations should be clearly stated. Failure to comply with this section will result in the Commissioner voiding the complaint. If the complainant requests action after the 10-business day deadline, they may file a new Stage 1 complaint. 

5.	Registration of Complaint in Exceptional Circumstances 
The Commissioner is permitted to register a complaint (and proceed to Stage 2 review) before the 10-day period for advertiser's response has elapsed, for example, when regulatory or independent medical advice suggests that the claims may constitute an imminent and/ or significant health hazard. 


G)	Complaints Resolution Stage 2: 
The Commissioner's Reassessment 

1.	Commissioner's Reassessment 
Once a complaint has been registered, the Commissioner will conduct a reassessment of the complaint and may issue rulings. 

2.	Scope of the Reassessment 
In the reassessment, the Commissioner shall examine the letter of complaint and the advertiser's response. The review shall include evaluation of the data supporting promotional claims and if the APS had been previously reviewed, an examination of the way the Code was applied. The Commissioner may consult with PAAB Reviewers to request a revised opinion based on additional considerations, or may engage external advice.

3.	Outcomes of the Reassessment 
The Commissioner will attempt to clarify the issue and narrow down the areas of disagreement. If an agreement between complainant and advertiser is thought to be feasible, the Commissioner may recommend further dialogue, a face-to-face meeting or other conciliation attempts. If none is possible, the Commissioner will issue a ruling, rejecting or accepting all or part of the complaint and as part of this ruling may withdraw clearance for the APS. Also the ruling may address the issue of whether a registration fee under Section 1.7.E.6: Registration of Complaints to Proceed to Stage 2 Resolution 

4.	Timelines 
The Commissioner's reassessment will be completed within 15-business days, although this period may be extended by two weeks if written notice is given to both companies. 

H)	Complaint Resolution Stage 3: 
The Review Panel

1.	Right of Appeal 
This right exists for the use of pharmaceutical industry sponsors of advertising. Either the complainant or advertiser has the right to appeal the Commissioner's reassessment ruling to a Review Panel. Notice of appeal must be provided within 5- business days after the date of the ruling, in a letter to the Commissioner from a senior ofãcial of the organization. 

2.	Composition of Review Panel 
The appeal will be heard by a Review Panel, comprised of three qualified individuals. The Commissioner will select these three persons from a larger pool of individuals named by national organizations in response to a request from PAAB; the pool may contain physicians, pharmacists or senior pharmaceutical marketing officials. The Commissioner will request one Panelist to act as Chair. Subject to availability of Panelists, the hearing shall normally be held within 6 weeks of receipt of notice of appeal. 

3.	Panel Decisions 
Decisions by review panels are binding and final. 

4.	Objection to the Selection of Review Panel Members 
Each party will be notified in writing of the selected Panel Members. Either party may object to the inclusion of an individual Panelist if the objecting party has a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of such Panelist. Such objection must be registered in writing to the Commissioner within 2-business days. 

5.	Conflict of interest 
Each person acting as a Review Panelist will be required to attest that he or she has no conflict of interest in participating in the appeal process. 

6.	Costs 
The party that is unsuccessful at appeal (whether that is the complainant or the advertiser), is liable to pay $5,000 plus actual costs for the review panel and preparation. In the event that the Review Panel decides partially in favour of both companies, the panel shall determine the appropriate sharing of costs between the two companies.  

7.	Written Submissions 
The appellant must assemble its case in writing, along with supporting literature. If this material is extensive, the appellant is encouraged to provide an executive summary of no more than 5 pages in length. Per Complaints Resolution Stage 2 this material must be delivered within 15 business days of the said ruling to the Commissioner (meaning 10 business days after expiry of the right to appeal) who will ensure it is distributed to Panelists and to the other party. The appellant is permitted one extension of 5 business days for the delivery of the written case if notice of the extension is provided to the Commissioner and the other party.

After receipt of the written case, the other party will have 15-business days to prepare a written response and deliver it to the Commissioner, and is permitted one extension of 5-business days for the delivery of the written response if notice of the extension is provided to the Commissioner and the appellant. 

If either the written case or the response is longer than 20 pages, including appendices, 5 copies of the complete package should be delivered. 

The Commissioner will ensure that the written case and the response are delivered to the panel members and to both parties to the appeal, at least 7-days in advance of the panel hearing. 

8.	Oral Presentation 
The appellant will be called upon to make a brief and concise oral presentation of its case. The other party will then have an opportunity to respond. A PAAB Reviewer will be permitted to describe the basis for the original ruling. Panel members may then direct questions to any party. The Chair may permit questions or comments from one party to the other, subject to both sides being given equal opportunity. 

The oral presentations are intended to summarize the written arguments. Neither company may employ any new evidence that was not cited in the written case.  

9.	Panel Decision Process 
After the oral presentation, the panel will retire for a private discussion before making its decision. The decision will be made by majority vote. The conclusions made by the Panel will be sent to both parties via electronic means within 5- business days of the hearing. A signed hard copy of the decision will be delivered to both parties thereafter. 

10.	Implementation of Panel Decision 
If the Panel decision is not clear concerning the implementation of the decision on the clearance status of a particular APS, or concerning the schedule for replacing the withdrawn APS discussed in Withdrawal of Preclearance (/processoperations.htm#1_6_1), the Commissioner will write an implementation letter to specify the effect of the panel decision. 

11.	Attendance at the Hearing 
The two parties are asked to limit their representation at the meeting to three persons. 

12.	Public Reporting 
Information such as the parties involved, a summary of the major points at issue, and whether the appeal was upheld in Review Panel decision may be reported to the public. 

13.	Failure to Co-operate with Procedure 
It is anticipated that Stage 3 Review Panel hearings will be rare, and all companies are expected to co-operate with these procedures. The Commissioner may deem a company to have failed to co-operate with the procedure if, for example, it refuses to prepare a written response or to appear at the hearing, or objects in an unreasonable manner to the selection of panelists. If the company fails to co-operate and, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is likely to gain a material commercial benefit from this failure to co-operate, the Commissioner is authorized to proceed with the Review Panel hearing and decision without that company's co-operation. In such a case, the Commissioner is directed to ensure a high degree of fairness in the processes of the Review Panel, in the selection of Panelists, and presentation of written and oral material before the Panel.  

14.	Modifications to Review Panel Procedure if Complainant is not a Pharmaceutical Company 
Certain procedures in Complaints and Appeals will be modified when the complainant is not a pharmaceutical company: 

i)	These complainants are not liable to pay costs in Costs. 

ii)	If the advertiser has taken the issue to appeal (because the advertiser lost the Stage 2 Commissioner's reassessment), and the complainant does not wish to play an active role at the Review Panel stage, the Commissioner will take steps to ensure that the complainants' case is brought forward for assessment by the Review Panel, including the preparation and submission of a written response based largely on the initial complaint, and presentation of an oral submission. 

iii)	If the complainant has taken the issue to appeal, and in the opinion of the Commissioner the questions at issue are principally policy issues that should be brought to the attention of the Board of Directors, the Commissioner is authorized to send the issues to the Board of Directors for discussion rather than to invoke the Review Panel Complaints Resolution Stage 3. After this discussion, the Board of Directors would authorize a response to the complainant. The referral to the Board of Directors is appropriate when the questions at issue, in the opinion of the Commissioner, relate more to the complainants' views as to how the PAAB Code should be written rather than matters of fact or interpretation of the existing Code. 

I)	Appeals of negative PAAB preclearance rulings for a proposed APS 

1.	Right of Appeal 
Apart from appeals relating to third-party complaints that are defined in Sections 1.7.B to 1.7.H, an advertiser who has submitted a proposed APS has the right to appeal a negative clearance ruling, on first submission or resubmission. 

2.	Discussion with Commissioner 
Advertisers are encouraged to discuss their differences first with the Commissioner. The advertiser may request that the Commissioner review the file, and the Commissioner may confirm or revise the negative preclearance ruling. 

3.	Appeal to Review Panel 
If not resolved in: "Discussion with Commissioner", and if the company wishes to appeal an issue further, a written notice of appeal must be signed by a senior official of the appellant organization asking that the matter be heard by a Review Panel. 

4.	Procedure for Review Panel 
The Commissioner will ask the PAAB Chair to convene a panel of three PAAB Directors to hear the complaint and make a decision. A decision shall be sought within 30 days. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the appellant company is liable to pay $5,000 plus actual costs.


J)	Penalties, Remedial Measures & Public Reporting of Complaints
 
1.	Appropriate Penalties 
In rulings on complaints and in the implementation of Panel Decisions, the Commissioner may set out penalties against companies for Code violations. The appropriate penalty will be selected in accordance with the degree of the Code violation. Examples of penalties could range from immediate withdrawal of offending advertising, to notices in annual reports or newsletters, to public letters of apology. The Board of Directors may develop a Guideline on Penalties that outlines for the Commissioner's use a hierarchy of appropriate penalties, including penalties other than those mentioned above, with sanctions of increasing severity for serious or repeated violations. The Commissioner may inform the appropriate trade association to assess the complaint ruling for further penalties if warranted. 

2.	Remedial Measures 
When material has been disseminated that is substantially misleading, or where the information may cause inappropriate product use or constitutes an imminent and/or significant health hazard, the Commissioner may require remedial measures contained in letters of correction or published notices. The Commissioner must approve content and form of these remedial measures. The remedial measures should be distributed to the original target audience using the same or similar media and must be implemented within 30-days of the Commissioner's instruction. 

3.	Public Reporting 
The Commissioner is authorized to make public reports of notable Code violations in vehicles such as annual reports and newsletters. These reports shall include identification of the advertiser, the method of distribution, whether the information was submitted for PAAB review, the reason why the information was found to violate the Code, penalties required and any other relevant information. Particular attention is to be given to repeat offenses, and to advertisers that refuse to comply with a Commissioner's ruling or Review Panel decision. 

4.	Reporting to Board Members 
The Commissioner also will make annual summary reports of complaints and their disposition to Board members, including ex-officio members representing regulators. 

5.	Health Canada 
Where complaints have been brought to PAAB for resolution, and the advertiser has not complied with rulings by the Commissioner or a Review Panel, the Commissioner shall inform Health Canada to request an investigation within the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act. The Commissioner is also expected to bring to the attention of Health Canada advertising believed to present an imminent or significant health hazard. Detailed procedures are described in the current Health Canada document, setting out PAAB and Health Canada roles and consultation related to advertising review.

It can be explicit (i.e. text) or implicit (i.e. images), comparative or non-comparative. It can relate to pharmacological or non-pharmacological properties of the product. </p>
<p>Not all statements about a product are "marketing claims of benefit". Common examples of product messaging which are not considered marketing benefit claims include product reconstitution instructions, monitoring instructions, dosing modifications for special populations and storage instructions when these are presented as instructions/burdens rather than features/ benefits (i.e. presented to instruct rather than alter/form the audience's opinion of the medication in a positive way). How a statement is framed can sometimes affect whether it is a marketing benefit claim. For example, the copy "Arbace: Convenience of a single daily dose" is a marketing benefit claim, while "Patients should be instructed to take a single dose daily at the same time each day" is not. </p>

<h1 class="cn" id="cs3_1">3.1</h1>
<p>Claims and/or quotations in Advertising/Promotion Systems must be consistent with, and within the limitations of, the Health Canada TMA. Any APS containing direct or indirect product claims and/or quotes from scientific literature must include a complete listing of the scientific references. Labelling must be authorized by Health Canada. See Making Comparisons, Section 5, for claims that are of a comparative nature.</p>

<h1 class="cn explanatory" id="cs3_1_1">3.1.1</h1>
<p class="explanatory">Clinical or therapeutic claims must be based on published, peer-reviewed, controlled, and well-designed studies with clinical and statistical significance clearly indicated. Review articles, pooled data, meta-analysis, post-hoc analysis, and observational studies are generally regarded as not being evidence to support claims in drug advertising. Data included in the TMA may be acceptable. Additionally, high quality meta-analysis and observational studies may be acceptable. Non-clinical claims must be well supported by relevant evidence.</p>

<h1 class="cn explanatory" id="cs3_1_2">3.1.2</h1>
<p class="explanatory">Unpublished data is regarded as having received independent review when:</p>

<h1 class="cn" id="cs5">5 Making Comparisons</h1>

<p>	Forming part of the PAAB Code, reproduced here in bold, (Section 5.1 to 5.6) is the text of the Part 5 "Policy" from the Health Canada directive entitled Principles for Comparative Claims Related to the Therapeutic Aspects of Drugs.</p> 
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Consistent with the provisions of Section 9 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to observe the following principles in making claims that compare the therapeutic aspects of drugs:</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.1 </p>
<p>The compared drugs/products have an authorized indication for use in common, and the comparison is related to that use; or, in addition to the common indication for use, a second authorized indication is claimed as an added benefit of the advertised drug, and</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.2 </p>
<p>The comparison is drawn between drugs under the same conditions of use (e.g. equivalent part(s) of their authorized dose ranges (maximum vs. maximum dosage), in a similar population, and</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.3 </p>
<p>The claim does not conflict with the Terms of Market Authorization of the compared products (Note 1), and </p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.4 </p>
<p>The claim is of clinical relevance in humans, i.e. relevant to treatment selection, and, where this is not readily apparent, its clinical relevance can be justified by the sponsor, and </p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.5</p> 
<p>The evidence generated to substantiate the claim is conclusive and based on: </p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>Consideration of all relevant data, and </li>
	<li>Scientifically accurate, unbiased, reproducible data obtained from studies conducted and analyzed to current scientific standards using established research methodologies and validated end points, and </li>
	<li>Appropriate interpretation of the data (Note 2). </li>
</ol>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.6 </p>
<p>The claim and its presentation should: </p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>Identify the compared entities (Note 3), and </li>
	<li>The medicinal use related to the claim where this is not readily apparent (Note 4), and </li>
	<li>Not obscure the therapeutic use of the advertised product/ingredient (Note 5), and </li>
	<li>Not attack the compared drug product(s)/ingredient(s) in an unreasonable manner, and </li>
	<li>Be expressed in terms, language and graphics that can be understood by the intended audience. </li>
</ol>
<p>Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that comparative claims that fall within the scope of these Health Canada Principles, meet these requirements. Furthermore, all comparisons must satisfy the requirements of the full PAAB Code, including the following provisions:</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.7 </p>
<p>Comparative claims of efficacy and safety generally require support of evidence from head-to-head, well-designed, adequately controlled, blinded, randomized clinical studies. Open-label studies are generally not considered to be a high level of evidence and are not acceptable if subjective end-points are included in the study. Comparative claims should be consistent with current medical opinion and practice. Canadian guidelines are to be adhered to. In the event that they are not available, see the following document on what constitutes current medical opinion.</p>

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs">5.7.1 </p>
<p class="explanatory">Adverse events and clinical efficacy data quoted from two or more TMAs or derived from studies that were not head-to-head, are not acceptable support for comparative claims of clinical safety or efficacy. This is due to the fact that factors such as study methodologies, patient populations, dosing and measurement criteria used in the separate trials can vary widely. Furthermore, a side-by-side presentation of these adverse events and efficacy data, which lack comparability, could leave a misleading impression and does not meet the PAAB Code acceptance standards.</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.8 </p>
<p>Methodologies, endpoints and independent review. To be considered as evidence, clinical studies must use established research methodologies and validated endpoints. To aid in the assessment of these study parameters, PAAB looks for evidence that the full study results have been subject to independent review, such as that found by achieving the publishing of study results, including statistical analyses, in a peer-reviewed journal. (Note 6)</p>

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs">5.8.1 </p>
<p class="explanatory">Alternatively, unpublished data are regarded as having received independent review when: </p>
<ol type="i" class="explanatory">
	<li>There is evidence that the full study manuscript has been accepted by the editor of a peer-reviewed journal for future publication, or alternatively when </li>
	<li>The data have been reviewed as part of a submission to Health Canada and there is evidence of acceptance (such as inclusion in the TMA). </li>
</ol>

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs">5.8.2 </p>
<p class="explanatory">When presented only in the following form, study design and results analyses are not regarded as having been subject to independent review and are not sufficient evidence to be used as reference support for advertising claims: </p>
<ol type="i" class="explanatory">
	<li>Abstracts presented at conferences and in journal supplements. </li>
	<li>Papers published in journal supplements unless the advertiser can demonstrate that the supplement has also been subject to an adequate peer review process.</li>
</ol>

<p class="cn" id="cs5_9">5.9 </p>
<p>Analysis of Data: To be considered as evidence, results must achieve an acceptable level of statistical significance. Where confidence intervals (CI) and p-values are both available, the manufacturer may decide to report both. The use of 95% CI is encouraged in preference to p-value. The use of 90% CI is acceptable for presentations of pharmacokinetic data. Failure of study results to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the measured effect is not sufficient to support a claim of equivalence between the treatments studied.</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.10 </p>
<p>All direct and indirect comparisons must not mislead and be supported by reliable current data.</p>

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs">5.10.1 </p>

<p class="explanatorysub">For comparisons of non-clinical data (e.g. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), no direct or indirect clinical conclusions may be made in advertising unless a strong correlation can be established (e.g. where the rate of absorption is a direct measure of the onset of symptom relief). </p>

<p class="cn explanatorysub" id="cs">5.10.1.iv </p>
<p class="explanatorysub">Price comparisons that imply or suggest therapeutic equivalence are not acceptable. A disclaimer may be appropriate. </p>

<ol type="i" class="explanatory">
	<li>Market share and price claims, must be based on and referenced to, current authoritative data and must not state or imply therapeutic equivalence. </li>
	<li>Other non-therapeutic product claims, such as taste or packaging, require support from adequate, unbiased and statistically valid Data. </li>
	<li>Information from two or more TMA on products' properties (Note 7) and on instructions for use or use limitations (Note 8) may be acceptable as side-by-side presentations and in text form. While the Code permits products to be accurately differentiated by these parameters, no clinical significance must be stated or implied where none has been proven, as is required under the Code for any statement.

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs">5.10.3</p>

This information should be in prominent type size (a minimum of 8 point on 9 point). In no circumstances would extrapolation of the claim beyond the actual conditions of the supporting studies be acceptable. Information such as study methodology, description of patient type and number, disease severity, dosage range, study sites, etc. may appear with the product information.</p>

Accurate statements may be made about the interchangeability of products recognized on various formularies. Claims of therapeutic equivalence must be based on comparative evidence.</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.14 </p>
<p>Formulation. Studies using non-Canadian products are not accepted unless the advertised Canadian product is identical (for example identical master formula) to the corresponding non-Canadian product used in the original studies. A letter from the sponsor's Medical/Regulatory Department would be required.</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.15</p> 
<p>Scare tactics. Advertising that induces fear or uses scare tactics to introduce unwarranted concern will not be accepted.</p> 

<p class="cn" id="cs">5.16 </p>
<p>Superlatives. Unless substantiation can be provided, advertisers may not claim or imply that a product has a superlative feature or function (e.g., comments such as most effective, or least toxic), or is accorded special status (such as being unique). Similarly, advertisers may not, without substantiation, claim or imply superiority or special status for a company, its personnel, services, or product line. </p>

<h1>6 Patient Information</h1>

<p>Company controlled or prepared branded patient information is information that contains non-promotional material that is consistent with, and in addition to, the Health Canada approved patient information (e.g. the consumer information section of the product monograph, patient insert, approved product labelling). The information should focus on educating patients about particular diseases/conditions and optimal use of the product by the patient for whom it has been prescribed.</p> 

<p>This information should address patients' expectations through encouraging meaningful dialogue between patient and healthcare professional and supplementing this dialogue with the best available evidence-based statements. </p>

<p>All health product information must be consistent with the Terms of Market Authorization (TMA), and should not contain promotional claims. </p>

<p>The Advertising/Promotion Systems (APS) could contain additional sources of health information from standard setting organizations. It should be written in clear, understandable and legible language. </p>

<p>Principles for education on optimal use of the product and diseases/conditions:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Principle 1: Clarity of message</li> 
<li>Principle 2: Management of expectations</li>
<li>Principle 3: Evidence-based information</li>

<p>Product information in pharmaceutical Advertising / Promotion Systems (APS) must conform to the requirements outlined in Section 7.3 of the Code. Indications for use of a pharmaceutical product must conform to the Health Canada authorized Product Monograph, or, if there is no monograph, the accepted Prescribing Information.

<p class="explanatorysub">The following link destinations are acceptable:</p>
<ul class="explanatorysub">
	<li>The TMA and the risk communication on the Health Canada website. The requirement relating to the TMA can be met by linking to the appropriate database search engine page (such as the Drug Product Database, Licensed Natural Health Products Database). This option may not be available for new products or those having recently undergone TMA revision due to Health Canada delays in posting which are beyond the advertiser's control. The requirement relating to the risk communication can be met linking to the MedEffect Canada page. </li>
	<li>A direct link to the TMA and the risk communication on the corresponding Canadian gated product website (such as www.productnamePM.ca)</li>
	<li>A direct link to the TMA and the risk communication on the Market Authorization Holder's corporate website (such as www.companynamePM.ca)</li>

<p class="cn explanatorysub" id="cs7_3_2e">7.3.2e </p>
<p class="explanatorysub">Where mandated by the consumer advertising regulations, websites housing any content in addition to the TMA and risk communications must be either be gated or de-indexed from search engines (i.e. such that there is no consumer access through search engine results).</p>
<p class="explanatorysub">If the site is gated, the URL or electronic link promoted in the APS must bypass the gate such that password entry is not required to access these disclosure documents. The URL and electronic link must therefore be promoted only to HCPs.</p>

<p class="cn" id="cs7_4">7.4 Corporate Advertising / Promotion Systems (APS)</p>
<p>These are designed to create and maintain a favorable image of a company, its products and its services. See Section 1.5: Materials Not Subject to PAAB Review.
These systems may be used at any time at the discretion of the advertiser but must be submitted for PAAB preclearance prior to publication. They must not contain therapeutic or other claims of product merit or status. They may contain: </p>

	<li>A partial or complete list or illustration of products manufactured and/ or distributed by the company, along with their respective therapeutic or pharmacologic classifications.</li>
	<li>Product information does not have to accompany corporate advertising.</li>
</ol>

<p class="cn" id="cs7_5">7.5 Editorial Advertising / Promotion Systems (APS)</p>

<p>Editorial advertisements are used to present company opinions on current issues, and disseminate updated information relative to therapeutic or pharmacologic class areas in which the company has a vested interest. This may include objective, balanced and scientifically rigorous information with discussion of therapeutic aspects of, or research related to, drugs. There is no emphasis on information specifically about the sponsor's product(s). The information on a specific drug is consistent with the current TMA for that drug.</p>
<ul>
	<li>They comprise company-generated open letters, editorials, congress, conference and meeting reports, etc. published as paid advertising.</li>
	<li>They must be clearly identified as advertising to distinguish them from other editorial presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>All such materials must be submitted for preclearance prior to distribution to health professionals.</p>

<p class="cn explanatory" id="cs7_5_1">7.5.1</p>
<p class="explanatory">Publication by the company of single-sponsored editorial reports in compliance with the company's Health Canada authorized product(s) information is acceptable. In addition to identifying the article as advertising, the author(s) should be identified along with any link to the sponsoring company.</p>
<p class="explanatory">The material may make reference to investigational research and must include a disclaimer that a drug has not been authorized for such use in Canada and other pertinent qualifying information. Data presentations or any claims such as clinical efficacy, safety, dosage and administration for products that have not yet been authorized for marketing (pre-NOC) will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="explanatory">Healthcare Product branding elements should not be used in non-branded APS that contain statements, visuals, and references that would not be accepted in a product APS. All copyright regulations must be respected.</p>
