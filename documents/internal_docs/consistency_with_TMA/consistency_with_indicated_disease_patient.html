    <h1>Consistency with indicated disease/condition & patient population</h1>
    <p>This page elaborates on how <a href="../doc_list/code/code.html#cs3_1">PAAB code section 3.1</a> applies to the presentation of study results in drug advertising specifically with regards to the promoted product's authorized diseases/conditions and patient population.</p>
 
    <h2>Indicated Disease/Condition</h2>
    <p>This is how PAAB code section 3.1 [link to code] applies to the presentation of study results in drug advertising specifically with regards to the promoted product's authorized disease(s)/condition(s).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Presentation of study results in advertising cannot allude to uses beyond the specific disease(s)/condition(s) authorized by Health Canada</li>
            <li>Presentation of study results in advertising can allude to uses that span across the entirety of any individual authorized disease or condition.</li>
            <li>Presentation of study results in advertising can allude to uses that span across a subsection of any individual authorized disease or condition (i.e., a slice of the pie)</li>
        </ul>

    <p>For example, if a medication is authorized for the management of asthma, an advertisement may not refer to a study evaluating COPD patients. This would contravene PAAB Code section 3.1 in addition to section 9.1 of the Food and Drug's Act.</p>

    <p><strong>This does not only apply to distinctly different diseases but also distinct characteristics within the same disease severity such as stages or severity levels.</strong> For example, if a product is authorized for the management of mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease, an advertisement cannot include data presentations pertaining to a group of patients with severe alzheimer's disease at baseline, nor can it include data presentations pertaining to a group of patients covering the entire spectrum of mild to severe alzheimer's disease at baseline. However, the advertisement could include study results relating to the a preplanned subgroup analysis for the patients having mild alzheimer's disease at baseline.</p> 

    
    <h2>Patient Population</h2>
    <p>While we focused on disease characteristics above, the exact same approach applies to patient characteristics. The patient population refers to the specific group of people that the medication is authorized for. This is how PAAB code section 3.1 [link to code] applies to the presentation of study results in drug advertising specifically with regards to the promoted product's authorized patient population.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Presentation of study results in advertising cannot allude to patient characteristics that go beyond those covered by the corresponding indication.</li>
        <li>Presentation of study results in advertising can allude to uses that span across the entirety of the patient characteristics covered by the corresponding indication.</li>
        <li>Presentation of study results in advertising can allude to uses that span across a subsection of the patient characteristics covered by the corresponding  (i.e., a slice of the pie)</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>For example, if a medication is authorized for adults up to the age of 65 years old, an advertisement may not refer to a study evaluating patients above 65 years old, or a study evaluating patients between the ages of 40 to 70 years old. However, a study (or pre-planned subpopulation) evaluating patients between the ages of 30 to 50 years old would be acceptable.</p>
    
    <p>This approach helps ensure that medication advertisements are truthful and relevant to those for whom the health professional is considering treatment options. It's all about making sure the information is clear, accurate, and based on approved uses.</p>
