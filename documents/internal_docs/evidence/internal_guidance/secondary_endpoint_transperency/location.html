    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Endpoint Transparency. Positioning of "secondary".</p>
    <p>When identifying the secondary endpoints in the APS data presentation by labeling them as "secondary endpoint", this disclosure should appear EITHER in the claim or in a related claim/graph/table immediately following it (i.e., the disclosure is not required to occur within the very first mention of the endpoint as long as it is clearly tied to that first mention). For example:</p>
    <img src="secondary_endpoint_positioning.jpg" alt="A section of a presentation slide with text against a blue and pink gradient background. At the top, the words '...below (DLQI) the surface' are partially visible. The main body text highlights HUMIRA's improvements in DLQI scores at weeks 4 and 16, with 'the assessment of DLQI scores were secondary endpoints of the REVEAL clinical trial' directly below in smaller print. This is set above a pink block stating 'HUMIRA. Indicated in the inflammatory conditions...' with various medical abbreviations. The word 'secondary' is closely associated with 'DLQI', complying with transparency requirements for labeling endpoints in data presentations." title="Secondary Endpoint Transparency - The word 'secondary' is positioned clearly below the key endpoint 'DLQI', adhering to guidelines for immediate association in APS data presentations.">
