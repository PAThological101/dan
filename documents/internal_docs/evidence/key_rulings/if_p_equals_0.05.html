<p>Subject: Question about p-values</p>
    
<p>Hey Patrick,</p>
<p>I've just seen something for the first time. The endpoint of interest had a p-value exactly equal to 0.05. Is this considered a statistically significant finding? The client feels strongly that she should be able to make some sort of conclusion in the APS.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Viv</p>

<p>Hey Viv. Close but no cigar. The p-value must be less than (not including) 0.05 in order for the outcome to be considered statistically significant. As with any case in which a statistically significant finding was not obtained, the only inference that can be conveyed in the APS is that a statistical difference was not attained between the study groups.</p>
<p>Thx,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>
