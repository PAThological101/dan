<p>Hey Patrick,</p>
<p>Working on a reprint for Actemra.  Here are the objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The primary outcome was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of tocilizumab-SC to tocilizumab-IV with regard to the proportion of patients in each group achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24 using a 12% non-inferiority margin (NIM). Secondary outcomes were disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28), ACR responses, health assessment questionnaire scores and safety assessments.</li>
    <li>They established non-inferiority with ACR20 with the SC dosage form of Actemra vs. the IV dosage form.  We can’t then establish non-inferiority for the secondary outcomes listed (i.e. DAS28, ACR 50/70, HAQ-DI) right??  Because they are using the ‘similar’ claim for the secondary outcomes as well…I can’t tell…</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Viv</p>

<p>Hey Viv. The answer is no.</p>
<p>p=NS for secondary endpoints in an NI study never means non-inferiority.</p> 
<p>Two key things to keep in mind:</p>  
<ol>
    <li>The appropriate NI margin is dependent on the endpoint & population (these are rarely stated a-priori for secondary endpoints).</li>
    <li>An inference of non-inferiority  is actually a statistically significant finding (not p=NS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thx,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>
