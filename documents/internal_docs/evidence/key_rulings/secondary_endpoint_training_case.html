    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Endpoint Transparency. Training Case:</p>
    <p>An APS features data from a pivotal trial in the product monograph (the ACME8 study). Initially, the reviewer was not planning to comment on the lack of differentiation between primary and secondary endpoints in the APS as the data comes from the TMA (which also does not make this distinction). However, in a subsequent part of the APS presentation, the reviewer noted that some of the data for this study does not come from the TMA. The reviewer deems that the data from the ACME8 reference is acceptable. Which of the following would you do as the reviewer?</p>
    <ol type='A'>
        <li>Maintain the initial plan of not requesting that the APS differentiate between primary and secondary endpoints</li>
        <li>Require that the APS differentiate between primary and secondary endpoints, but only for the data originating from sources other than the TMA</li>
        <li>Require that the entire APS differentiate between primary and secondary endpoints</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Option A does not work as the APS would be contravening s3.1.10 without coverage from being consistent with the TMA. Option B might initially appear compelling as it addresses the parts of the APS which are not covered by the TMA while leaving the parts covered by the TMA alone. However, this may actually do more harm than good. Labeling some data with “secondary endpoint” risks conveying that elements of the presentation which aren't labeled in this manner are not secondary endpoints. Ultimately, as the overall presentation is no longer confined to data from the TMA, the best option is to require the distinction between primary and secondary endpoints to be clear throughout the presentation.</p>
    <p>APSs are rarely comprised solely from TMA data. It is also rare that none of the TMA data differentiates between primary and secondary endpoints. So the most practical approach is to ALWAYS request that the presentation clearly distinguishes between primary and secondary endpoints. Just know that there may be merit to client push-back that the piece is comprised solely of data from a TMA which doesn't differentiate between primary and secondary endpoints.</p>
